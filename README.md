Raw(g) Data is a data visualization of game popularity data and critical review data from Rawg.io and Metacritic. Users of Raw(g) Data are able to pick a year of data they wish to see and then filter that data using the "Filter by Popularity" and "Filter by Metacritic Score" buttons. Users are then shown charts corresponding to their button presses, with either a user popularity chart or a critical review data chart showing up. These charts show a list of games from the selected year that are ordered either by popularity or review scores. Data is taken from the Rawg.io API.

Rawg.io is a gaming social media site where users can talk about and rate video games they have played. Metacritic is an aggregate review website where reviewers can post their review scores for a game and contribute to the total average review score for a game. 

On the technical side Raw(g) Data is made purely using Javascript and HTML. The backend/data for the project comes from the Rawg.io API, and the charts were made using Chart.js. Webpack is also used to run the local server for testing purposes.
